# Privacy Policy for Elixir Browser

**Last updated:** 2025-12-14

The Elixir Browser Project (hereinafter referred to as "we", "us", or "our") respects the privacy of users of "Elixir Browser" (hereinafter referred to as "this app"). This Privacy Policy explains our stance on user data and network communication.

## 1. Data Collection and Transmission
**We do not collect, store, or share any personal information, browsing history, or input data.**

*   **No Server-Side Collection:** We do not operate any servers for collecting or analyzing user data. Therefore, it is technically impossible for us to receive your data.
*   **Local Storage:** All data generated within this app (bookmarks, history, passwords, settings, etc.) is stored exclusively on your local device.
*   **No Interception:** We do not intercept, monitor, or transmit any data related to your browsing activities.

## 2. Chromium and Google Services
This app is based on the Chromium open-source project. While we have removed or disabled as many Google-specific tracking, telemetry, and metrics features as possible for the purpose of optimization and privacy, please note the following:

*   **Residual Communication:** As part of the core browser engine's functionality, some inherent Chromium mechanisms (such as component updates or security-related lists like CRLSet) may still involve communication with Google servers.
*   **User-Triggered Features:** If you choose to use specific features that rely on external services (such as Google Translate or Search Suggestions), the app will communicate with those respective providers to fulfill the request.
*   **Effort of Removal:** We strive to ensure a "de-googled" experience by removing unnecessary background traffic, but we do not guarantee the 100% elimination of all communications inherent to the Chromium engine.

## 3. Third-Party Services
To provide specific functionalities, the app may connect to the following external services:

*   **DuckDuckGo / Google (Favicons):** To display website icons (favicons) on the Speed Dial, the app may retrieve images from DuckDuckGo or Google servers based on the URL. This process is a direct connection between your device and their servers.
*   **Search Engine:** Your search queries are sent directly to the search engine provider you have selected in the settings.

## 4. Location Information
This app does not collect location information in the background. Location access is only processed when a website you visit explicitly requests permission and you grant it. This interaction is strictly between your device and that website.

## 5. Children’s Privacy
This app does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.

## 7. Contact Us
If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, please contact us.
